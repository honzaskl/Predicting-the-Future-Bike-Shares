This project, created by Jan Sklenička, Sebastian Černý, Vojtěch Chalupa, and Andrea Matějková, explores the predictive performance of four regression models to forecast hourly bike-sharing demand in London. Using open data from Transport for London (TfL), we compare:

🔹 XGBoost
🔹 Random Forest Regression
🔹 Linear Elastic Net Regression
🔹 Poisson Regression

Our goal is to identify the most accurate model to aid in urban planning and efficient management of shared bike resources.
